<h2>Hannah's Past</h2>

<img class="Family" src="./Hannah&#39;s Past, Present, and Future_files/fam.jpg" alt="My Family in 2011">
<p>I was born December 10, 1999 in Peoria, Illinois into a family with an 2 1/2 year old sister, an orange cat, and two parents. I was heavy baby, weighing 9.12 lbs. After about one and a half years, we moved to Birmingham, Alabama and lived there for about five years. I moved to Greenville, South Carolina when I was six and attended <a href="https://www.greenville.k12.sc.us/oakview/">Oakview Elementary</a> from first to fifth grade. Starting in sixth grade, I went to Beck Academy through eighth grade. During my elementary and middle school career, I praticipated in activities like dance, gymnastics, soccer, and chorus.</p>

<h2>My Future</h2>
<p>In my future, I plan to attend Furman University for four years. I have not decided what I would like to major in yet but I want to study abroad somewhere in Europe. I will hopefully have a successful career and travel everywhere in my twenties. I will marry someone I love and have a <a href="http://www.localpuppybreeders.com/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/Miniature%20Goldendoodle%20puppy%20in%20the%20car.jpg">golden doodle puppy</a> and two kids. My family and I will travel frequently to the <a href="http://www.m2woman.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mountain-Girl-Success.jpg">mountains</a> and to foreign lands. This will all be possible if I get my act together and start getting serious about my grades.</p>
